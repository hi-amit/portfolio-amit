                <h3>Market research</h3>
                <h5 style="margin-top: 4px; font-weight: 500;">In order to establish user scenarios and to determine frustrations and motivations of the market. We performed a market research based on existing Elderly care platforms. 
                    People in their 60’s and 80’s tend to feel frustrated and alone when their family is living in some other places. Maintaining their health and the household work tend to increase more opportunities for Elderly care platforms. <br> <br>  People are interested for these types of services. We end up understanding quite a lot about existing platforms and types of experiences they are offering to elders.</h5>

                <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
                <h5 style="margin-top: 4px; font-weight: 500;">After identifying current competitors, spending time with their products, one common weakness that all these products have is the lack of simplicity of navigation within the application. There wasn’t a clear progressive flow of actions within the app, which is brought by the lack of distinction of important elements and inconsistent  visual presentation of the key action items.</h5>

                <h5 style="margin-top: 4px; font-weight: 500;">Going through existing platforms gave us a clear glimpse of what will be the user scenarios and what will be their outcome. We had a time constraint for the user interviews. So to go with the best solution we intended our work 
                    based on the UX best practices that is NPCI model.
                    <br><br>

                <h5 style="margin-top: 4px; font-weight: 500;">After completing the market research we wrote down all the possible user scenarios on sticky notes and began to cluster them.  </h5>

                <h5 style="margin-top: 4px; font-weight: 500;">We designed all the key screens necessary for fulfilling the tasks in the user flow. 
                    User scenarios allowed us to brainstorm different ideas on how to design different screens effectively. 
                    Each screen has been designed so that the user is able to focus on one main task, addressing the “lack of simplicity in navigation” that was found in the competitors’ platforms.</h5>
